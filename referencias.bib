Since the last public release in 2009, the LHC experiments have provided a number of very interesting data sets comprising minimum bias p-p, p-Pb and Pb-Pb interactions. We describe the changes required to the model to reproduce in detail the new data available from LHC and the consequences in the interpretation of these data. In particular we discuss the effect of the collective hadronization in p-p scattering. A different parametrization of flow has been introduced in the case of a small volume with high density of thermalized matter (core) reached in p-p compared to large volume produced in heavy ion collisions. Both parametrizations depend only on the geometry and the amount of secondary particles entering in the core and not on the beam mass or energy. The transition between the two flow regimes can be tested with p-Pb data. EPOS LHC is able to reproduce all minimum bias},

With the results of the first run of the LHC, the difference between post-LHC model predictions has been reduced at the same level as experimental uncertainties of cosmic ray experiments. At the same time new types of air shower observables, like the muon production depth, have been measured, adding new constraints on hadronic models. Currently no model is able to reproduce consistently all mass composition measurements possible with the Pierre Auger Observatory for instance. We review the current model predictions for various particle production observables and their link with air shower observables and discuss the future possible improvements.},

Full simulations are no longer feasible and tracking of a representative sub-sample of particles (so-called "thinning") has to be introduced. The paper describes the physical and mathematical basis of the thinning algorithms and demonstrates how different thinning methods can be compared. A thinning method using weight limitation is proposed to enhance statistical precision for particle densities at large core distances, where measurements of the highest energy cosmic rays are made. Comparison of the proposed algorithm to the classical Hillas thinning shows an improvement of a factor 10-100 in computing time, depending on the energy, angle of incidence and particle type of the cosmic ray. The proposed thinning method gives consistent results also when single showers are studied, while the classical Hillas thinning can only be used to study average distributions over a number of showers. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Furthermore, we defined a zenith-independent estimator $\rho$ 35 of the muon density by parametrizing the attenuation of the muonic signal due to the atmosphere and soil layer above the buried detectors and quantified the relevant systematic uncertainties for AMIGA.

In this paper an analysis with a simple Monte Carlo model is used to show that an optimum ground parameter can be identified for each individual shower. At this optimal core distance, ropt, the fluctuations in the expected signal, S(ropt), due to a lack of knowledge of the lateral distribution function are minimised. Furthermore it is shown that the optimum ground parameter is determined primarily by the array geometry, with little dependence on the energy or zenith angle of the shower or choice of lateral distribution function. For an array such as the Pierre Auger Southern Observatory, with detectors separated by 1500 m in a triangular configuration, the optimum distance at which to measure this characteristic signal is close to 1000 m. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

abstract = {An interpretation of Akeno giant air shower array (AGASA) data by comparing the experimental results with the simulated ones by cosmic ray simulation for KASCADE (CORSIKA) has been made. General features of the electromagnetic component and low energy muons observed by AGASA can be well reproduced by CORSIKA. The form of the lateral distribution of charged particles agrees well with the experimental one between a few hundred metres and 2000 m from the core, irrespective of the hadronic interaction model studied and the primary composition (proton or iron). It does not depend on the primary energy between 1017.5 and 1020 eV as the experiment shows. If we evaluate the particle density measured by scintillators of 5 cm thickness at 600 m from the core S0(600), suffix 0 denotes the vertically incident shower) by taking into account the similar conditions as in the experiment, the conversion relation from S0(600) to the primary energy is expressed as E(eV)=2.15×1017S0(600)1.015 within 10{\%} uncertainty among the models and composition used, which suggests the present AGASA conversion factor is the lower limit. Although the form of the muon lateral distribution fits well to the experiment within 1000 m from the core, the absolute values change with hadronic interaction model and primary composition. The slope of the $\rho$$\mu$(600) (muon density above 1 GeV at 600 m from the core) vs. S0(600) relation in experiment is flatter than that in simulation of any hadronic model and primary composition. As the experimental slope is constant from 1015 to 1019 eV, we need to study this relation in a wide primary energy range to infer the rate of change of chemical composition with energy.},

abstract = {Lateral distributions for electrons and muons in extensive air showers measured with the array of the KASCADE experiment are compared to results of simulations based on the high-energy hadronic interaction models QGSJet and SIBYLL. It is shown, that the muon distributions are well described by both models. Deviations are found for the electromagnetic component, where both models predict a steeper lateral shape than observed in the data. For both models the observed lateral shapes of the electron component indicate a transition from a light to a more heavy composition of the cosmic ray spectrum above the knee. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.
