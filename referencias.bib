Interactions are treated in the framework of the Reggeon Field Theory, taking into consideration enhanced Pomeron diagrams which are resummed to all orders in the triple-Pomeron coupling. Soft and ``semihard'' contributions to the underlying parton dynamics are accounted for within the ``semihard Pomeron'' approach. The structure of cut enhanced diagrams is analyzed; they are regrouped into a number of subclasses characterized by positively-defined contributions which define partial weights for various ``macro-configurations'' of hadronic final states. An iterative procedure for a Monte Carlo generation of the structure of final states is described. The model results for hadronic cross sections and for particle production are compared to experimental data.},

abstract = {EPOS is a Monte-Carlo event generator for minimum bias hadronic interactions, used for both heavy ion interactions and cosmic ray air shower simulations. Since the last public release in 2009, the LHC experiments have provided a number of very interesting data sets comprising minimum bias p-p, p-Pb and Pb-Pb interactions. We describe the changes required to the model to reproduce in detail the new data available from LHC and the consequences in the interpretation of these data. In particular we discuss the effect of the collective hadronization in p-p scattering. A different parametrization of flow has been introduced in the case of a small volume with high density of thermalized matter (core) reached in p-p compared to large volume produced in heavy ion collisions. Both parametrizations depend only on the geometry and the amount of secondary particles entering in the core and not on the beam mass or energy. The transition between the two flow regimes can be tested with p-Pb data. EPOS LHC is able to reproduce all minimum bias},

abstract = {In detailed air shower simulations, the uncertainty in the prediction of shower observable for different primary particles and energies is currently dominated by differences between hadronic interaction models. With the results of the first run of the LHC, the difference between post-LHC model predictions has been reduced at the same level as experimental uncertainties of cosmic ray experiments. At the same time new types of air shower observables, like the muon production depth, have been measured, adding new constraints on hadronic models. Currently no model is able to reproduce consistently all mass composition measurements possible with the Pierre Auger Observatory for instance. We review the current model predictions for various particle production observables and their link with air shower observables and discuss the future possible improvements.},

The astrophysical model we adopted consists of identical sources uniformly distributed in a comoving volume, where nuclei are accelerated through a rigidity-dependent mechanism.

We also show that uncertainties about physical quantities relevant to UHECR propagation and shower development have a non-negligible impact on the fit results.},

Full simulations are no longer feasible and tracking of a representative sub-sample of particles (so-called "thinning") has to be introduced. The paper describes the physical and mathematical basis of the thinning algorithms and demonstrates how different thinning methods can be compared. A thinning method using weight limitation is proposed to enhance statistical precision for particle densities at large core distances, where measurements of the highest energy cosmic rays are made. Comparison of the proposed algorithm to the classical Hillas thinning shows an improvement of a factor 10-100 in computing time, depending on the energy, angle of incidence and particle type of the cosmic ray. The proposed thinning method gives consistent results also when single showers are studied, while the classical Hillas thinning can only be used to study average distributions over a number of showers. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},
