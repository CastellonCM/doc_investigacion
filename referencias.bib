abstract = {The name AIRES (AIR-shower Extended Simulations) identifies a set of programs and subroutines to simulate particle showers produced after the incidence of high energy cosmic rays on the Earth's atmosphere, and to manage all the related output data. The physical algorithms currently used in AIRES main simulation programs are based on the corresponding procedures of the widely known MOCCA program originally developed by A. M. Hillas for the Haverah Park Cosmic Ray experiment. The particles taken into account in the simulations are: Gammas, electrons, positrons, muons, pions, kaons, eta mesons, nucleons and antinucleons, and nuclei up to Z=26. Electron and muon neutrinos are generated in certain processes (decays) and accounted for their energy, but not propagated. The primary particle can be any one of the already mentioned particles, with energy ranging from several GeV up to more than 1 ZeV ({\$}10{\^{}}{\{}21{\}}{\$} eV). An important characteristic of AIRES is that the simulation program is now capable of invoking external, user-written, programs to generate sets of particles to be injected in the stacks before starting the simulation of the corresponding shower. This kind of primary particle processing allows, for example, to process the first interaction of "exotic" primaries like neutrinos, including all the particles generated by ultra-high energy gamma ray conversion in the geomagnetic field before reaching the atmosphere, etc.},

Since the last public release in 2009, the LHC experiments have provided a number of very interesting data sets comprising minimum bias p-p, p-Pb and Pb-Pb interactions. We describe the changes required to the model to reproduce in detail the new data available from LHC and the consequences in the interpretation of these data. In particular we discuss the effect of the collective hadronization in p-p scattering. A different parametrization of flow has been introduced in the case of a small volume with high density of thermalized matter (core) reached in p-p compared to large volume produced in heavy ion collisions. Both parametrizations depend only on the geometry and the amount of secondary particles entering in the core and not on the beam mass or energy. The transition between the two flow regimes can be tested with p-Pb data. EPOS LHC is able to reproduce all minimum bias},

With the results of the first run of the LHC, the difference between post-LHC model predictions has been reduced at the same level as experimental uncertainties of cosmic ray experiments. At the same time new types of air shower observables, like the muon production depth, have been measured, adding new constraints on hadronic models.

At the highest energies we have increased the available statistics by including three more years of data in the analysis compared to our previous publications. We present estimates of the first two moments of the Xmax distribution and of the composition fractions over a large energy range, from 1017.2 eV to about 1019.6 eV. The composition fractions are estimated by fitting the Xmax distributions with four elemental groups represented by p, He, N and Fe and using post-LHC hadronic models.},

Full simulations are no longer feasible and tracking of a representative sub-sample of particles (so-called "thinning") has to be introduced. The paper describes the physical and mathematical basis of the thinning algorithms and demonstrates how different thinning methods can be compared. A thinning method using weight limitation is proposed to enhance statistical precision for particle densities at large core distances, where measurements of the highest energy cosmic rays are made. Comparison of the proposed algorithm to the classical Hillas thinning shows an improvement of a factor 10-100 in computing time, depending on the energy, angle of incidence and particle type of the cosmic ray. The proposed thinning method gives consistent results also when single showers are studied, while the classical Hillas thinning can only be used to study average distributions over a number of showers. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {To determine the size of an extensive air shower it is not necessary to have knowledge of the function that describes the fall-off of signal size from the shower core (the lateral distribution function). In this paper an analysis with a simple Monte Carlo model is used to show that an optimum ground parameter can be identified for each individual shower. At this optimal core distance, ropt, the fluctuations in the expected signal, S(ropt), due to a lack of knowledge of the lateral distribution function are minimised. Furthermore it is shown that the optimum ground parameter is determined primarily by the array geometry, with little dependence on the energy or zenith angle of the shower or choice of lateral distribution function. For an array such as the Pierre Auger Southern Observatory, with detectors separated by 1500 m in a triangular configuration, the optimum distance at which to measure this characteristic signal is close to 1000 m. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

abstract = {An interpretation of Akeno giant air shower array (AGASA) data by comparing the experimental results with the simulated ones by cosmic ray simulation for KASCADE (CORSIKA) has been made. General features of the electromagnetic component and low energy muons observed by AGASA can be well reproduced by CORSIKA. The form of the lateral distribution of charged particles agrees well with the experimental one between a few hundred metres and 2000 m from the core, irrespective of the hadronic interaction model studied and the primary composition (proton or iron). It does not depend on the primary energy between 1017.5 and 1020 eV as the experiment shows. If we evaluate the particle density measured by scintillators of 5 cm thickness at 600 m from the core S0(600), suffix 0 denotes the vertically incident shower) by taking into account the similar conditions as in the experiment, the conversion relation from S0(600) to the primary energy is expressed as E(eV)=2.15×1017S0(600)1.015 within 10{\%} uncertainty among the models and composition used, which suggests the present AGASA conversion factor is the lower limit. Although the form of the muon lateral distribution fits well to the experiment within 1000 m from the core, the absolute values change with hadronic interaction model and primary composition. The slope of the $\rho$$\mu$(600) (muon density above 1 GeV at 600 m from the core) vs. S0(600) relation in experiment is flatter than that in simulation of any hadronic model and primary composition. As the experimental slope is constant from 1015 to 1019 eV, we need to study this relation in a wide primary energy range to infer the rate of change of chemical composition with energy.},

abstract = {Cosmic rays with energies up to a few PeV are known to be accelerated within the Milky Way1,2. Traditionally, it has been presumed that supernova remnants were the main source of these very-high-energy cosmic rays3,4, but theoretically it is difficult to accelerate protons to PeV energies5,6 and observationally there simply is no evidence of the remnants being sources of hadrons with energies above a few tens of TeV7,8. One possible source of protons with those energies is the Galactic Centre region9. Here, we report observations of 1–100 TeV $\gamma$ rays coming from the ‘Cygnus Cocoon'10, which is a superbubble that surrounds a region of massive star formation. These $\gamma$ rays are likely produced by 10–1,000 TeV freshly accelerated cosmic rays that originate from the enclosed star-forming region Cyg OB2. Until now it was not known that such regions could accelerate particles to these energies. The measured flux likely originates from hadronic interactions. The spectral shape and the emission profile of the Cocoon changes from GeV to TeV energies, which reveals the transport of cosmic particles and historical activity in the superbubble.},

abstract = {An indirect measurement of the antiproton flux in cosmic rays is possible as the particles undergo deflection by the geomagnetic field. This effect can be measured by studying the deficit in the flux, or shadow, created by the Moon as it absorbs cosmic rays that are headed toward the Earth. The shadow is displaced from the actual position of the Moon due to geomagnetic deflection, which is a function of the energy and charge of the cosmic rays. The displacement provides a natural tool for momentum/charge discrimination that can be used to study the composition of cosmic rays. Using 33 months of data comprising more than 80 billion cosmic rays measured by the High Altitude Water Cherenkov observatory, we have analyzed the Moon shadow to search for TeV antiprotons in cosmic rays. We present our first upper limits on the p/p fraction, which in the absence of any direct measurements provide the tightest available constraints of ∼1{\%} on the antiproton fraction for energies between 1 and 10 TeV.},

HAWC, located between the peaks Sierra Negra and Pico de Orizaba in central Mexico, will be completed in the spring of 2015. However, the observatory has been collecting data in a partial configuration since mid-2013. With only part of the final array in data acquisition, HAWC has already accumulated a data set of nearly 100 billion air showers. These events are used to calibrate the detector angular reconstruction using the shadow of the Moon, and to measure the anisotropy in the arrival directions of cosmic rays above 1 TeV. Using data recorded between June 2013 and July 2014, we have observed a significant 10-4 anisotropy consisting of three statistically significant "hotspots" in the cosmic ray flux. We will discuss these first results from HAWC and compare them to previous measurements of anisotropy in the northern and southern sky.},

However, accurate modelling of charged cosmic-ray measurements with ground based gamma-ray observatories is becoming more and more important. We assess the model predictions on the gross behaviour of measurable air shower parameters in the energy (0.1-100 TeV) and altitude ranges most appropriate for detection by ground-based gamma-ray observatories. We go on to investigate the particle distributions just after the first interaction point, to examine how differences in the micro-physics of the models may compound into differences in the gross air shower behaviour. Differences between the models above 1 TeV are typically less than 10{\%}. However, we find the largest variation in particle densities at ground at the lowest energy tested (100 GeV), resulting from striking differences in the early stages of shower development.},

abstract = {After two years of operation, the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory has analyzed the TeV cosmic-ray sky over an energy range between {\$}2.0{\$} and {\$}72.8{\$} TeV. The HAWC detector is a ground-based air-shower array located at high altitude in the state of Puebla, Mexico. Using 300 light-tight water tanks, it collects the Cherenkov light from the particles of extensive air showers from primary gamma rays and cosmic rays. This detection method allows for uninterrupted observation of the entire overhead sky (2{\~{}}sr instantaneous, 8.5{\~{}}sr integrated) in the energy range from a few TeV to hundreds of TeV. Like other detectors in the northern and southern hemisphere, HAWC observes an energy-dependent anisotropy in the arrival direction distribution of cosmic rays. The observed cosmic-ray anisotropy is dominated by a dipole moment with phase {\$}\backslashalpha\backslashapprox40{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$} and amplitude that slowly rises in relative intensity from {\$}8\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}{\$} at 2 TeV to {\$}14\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}}{\$} around 30.3 TeV, above which the dipole decreases in strength. A significant large-scale ({\$}{\textgreater}60{\^{}}{\{}\backslashcirc{\}}{\$} in angular extent) signal is also observed in the quadrupole and octupole moments, and significant small-scale features are also present, with locations and shapes consistent with previous observations. Compared to previous measurements in this energy range, the HAWC cosmic-ray sky maps improve on the energy resolution and fit precision of the anisotropy. These data can be used in an effort to better constrain local cosmic-ray accelerators and the intervening magnetic fields.},

The wide field-of-view of HAWC naturally lends itself to unbiased all-sky surveys and newly developed event-by-event gamma-ray energy reconstruction algorithms have allowed unprecedented energy resolution. The sources presented here are the highest-energy sources ever detected. All are coincident with known lower-energy gamma-ray sources within our Galaxy. These objects may have implications for the sources of Galactic cosmic rays; since Galactic CRs have been observed up to PeV energies, sources accelerating particles to these energies must exist. These sources, called “PeVatrons”, would have corresponding hard gamma-ray spectra that extend to high energies without any spectral break or cutoff. We will present measurements of the spectra of these highest-energy gamma-ray sources and discuss if any of them can be identified as PeVatron candidates.},

abstract = {Recent measurements of the Geminga and B0656+14 pulsars by the gamma-ray telescope HAWC (along with earlier measurements by Milagro) indicate that these objects generate significant fluxes of very high-energy electrons. In this paper, we use the very high-energy gamma-ray intensity and spectrum of these pulsars to calculate and constrain their expected contributions to the local cosmic-ray positron spectrum. Among models that are capable of reproducing the observed characteristics of the gamma-ray emission, we find that pulsars invariably produce a flux of high-energy positrons that is similar in spectrum and magnitude to the positron fraction measured by PAMELA and AMS-02. In light of this result, we conclude that it is very likely that pulsars provide the dominant contribution to the long perplexing cosmic-ray positron excess.},
